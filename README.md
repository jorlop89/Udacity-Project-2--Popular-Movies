# Udacity-Project-2--Popular-Movies
This is the project that has been shown for the part 1-2 of the Udacity's program Associate Android Developer Fast Track.

The project has the following functionalities:

# Part 1:
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date

# Part 2:

- Allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
- Lastly, optimize your app experience for tablet.
- Extend the favorites ContentProvider to store the movie poster, synopsis, user rating, and release date, and display them even when offline.
- Implement sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailerâ€™s YouTube URL from the movie details screen.

NOTE: In this part, I try to give more information about the movie like the runtime and the genres of the movies.
